- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gatlanticus
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve been building projects in Django since 2015 and React since 2018, and will likely continue working in these languages for many more years, as my most important project (https://dendro.cloud) depends on them.
- ðŸŒ± I deploy my projects using gunicorn, nginx and systemd unit scripts. Iâ€™m currently learning bash scripting to automate as much of that work as possible.
